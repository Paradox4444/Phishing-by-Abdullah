Phishing Awareness Training
Create a presentation or online training module about phishing attacks. Educate others about recognizing and avoiding phishing emails, websites, and social engineering tactics
Basics of Phishing:

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers attempt to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details, by posing as a trustworthy entity. Phishing attacks usually occur through emails, text messages, or fake websites that mimic legitimate ones. The primary goal is to deceive victims into clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.

Common Types of Phishing:
Email Phishing: The most common form, where attackers send fake emails designed to look like theyâ€™re from reputable sources (banks, social media platforms, etc.).
Spear Phishing: A more targeted form of phishing where attackers customize their messages for specific individuals or organizations.
Smishing: Phishing attacks that use SMS (text messages) to deceive victims.
Vishing: Phishing over the phone, where attackers pose as legitimate institutions like banks or government agencies.
Clone Phishing: A legitimate, previously delivered email is cloned, but with malicious links or attachments replacing the original content.
Dangers of Phishing:
Phishing can lead to severe consequences, such as:

Identity Theft: Attackers can steal personal information and use it to commit fraud or other crimes.
Financial Losses: Victims can lose money through fraudulent transactions or stolen credit card details.
Reputation Damage: Phishing attacks on businesses can tarnish their reputation and erode customer trust.
Compromise of Sensitive Data: In organizations, phishing can result in data breaches, exposing confidential or proprietary information.
